# Car-color-recognition-using-CNN
Vehicule color recognition using CNN and developed with Deeplearning4j library

This is an implementation the car color recognition method described in the paper: "Vehicle Color Recognition using Convolutional
Neural Network" written by Reza Fuad Rachmadi and I Ketut Eddy Purnama. The model is intended to detect vehicule colors from traffic cameras. The model is implemented using Deeplearning4j library.

To simplify, our convolutional network will try to recognize 5 colors (Black, Blue, Grey, Red and White)
